I am a first-year PhD student at Chang'an University, and my research direction is artificial intelligence, intelligent pavement disease detection, image super-resolution reconstruction, etc.
My mentor is Professor Li Wei. I studied at Hefei University from 2017 to 2021 for my bachelor's degree, and from 2022 to 2024 at Chang'an University's School of Information Engineering for my master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering. I will start my doctoral studies in Transportation Information Engineering and Control from 2024.
